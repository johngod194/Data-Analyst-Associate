## Competency Domains Assessed

### Data Management
This domain focuses on preparing, cleaning, and transforming structured data for analysis.  
Key skills include:
- Identifying and resolving data quality issues  
- Cleaning inconsistent or missing data values  
- Working with multiple relational data sources  
- Performing SQL-based transformations aligned with business requirements  

These skills were assessed through hands-on SQL tasks requiring to execute targeted cleaning and transformation operations on datasets.

### Exploratory Analysis
Exploratory analytics involves investigating datasets to uncover patterns, trends, and relationships.  
Key skills include:
- Summarising variables and calculating descriptive statistics  
- Transforming raw data into formats suitable for reporting  
- Exploring product, customer, and operational metrics  
- Creating dataset groupings for comparison  

Assessment in this area included SQL-based exploratory tasks, supplemented by work in R or Python.

### Statistical Experimentation
This domain evaluates the ability to use **statistical reasoning** to support decision-making.  
Key skills include:
- Applying statistical approaches to analyse business questions  
- Understanding experimental design concepts  
- Evaluating data variability and trends  

These competencies are required to perform analytical experiments that guide business insights.

## Certification Process

### 1. Timed Exams
The certification involves timed, adaptive exams that evaluate competency across a broad range of topics.  
These exams are designed to assess both conceptual knowledge and the ability to solve analytical problems under real-world constraints.

**Core areas tested:**
- Data cleaning and preparation  
- Querying and summarising datasets  
- Understanding data structures and variable types  
- Statistical and analytical reasoning  
- Communicating conclusions effectively  

Adaptive testing ensures a high-confidence measurement of the candidate’s analytical skill level.

### 2. Practical Exam Submission  
The practical exam—**Grocery Store Sales**—requires the candidate to solve a real business problem involving a retail grocery chain.  
The dataset (as shown on page 1 of the practical exam) includes variables such as product type, brand, price, weight, year added, and sales metrics. :contentReference[oaicite:7]{index=7}

**Tasks include:**

#### Task 1: Identify Missing Values  
Determine how many products have missing `year_added` values.  
(Example from exam output on page 2.)  

#### Task 2: Clean and Validate Data  
Create a cleaned dataset by:
- Replacing missing categorical fields with "Unknown"  
- Replacing missing numeric fields with median or average values  
- Ensuring the dataset conforms to a defined schema (page 3)  
- Producing a validated, clean table (page 4)  


#### Task 3: Explore Pricing Variation  
Compute minimum and maximum prices for each product type.  
(Exam output on page 5.)  
:contentReference[oaicite:10]{index=10}

#### Task 4: Analyze High-Performing Categories  
Identify products in the Meat and Dairy categories where average units sold exceed 10.  
(Exam output on page 6.)

#### Formatting Check  
The exam includes an automated verification step ensuring naming and formatting compliance (pages 7–9).  
:contentReference[oaicite:12]{index=12}

This practical assessment evaluates the ability to:
- Clean and validate raw data  
- Produce accurate SQL queries  
- Calculate operational metrics  
- Communicate insights through structured outputs  

---

## Tools and Technologies Used
- **SQL** — primary tool for data cleaning and analysis  
- **Python** (supplementary) — validation and DataFrame operations in the practical exam  
- **DataCamp DataLab** — environment for executing and submitting the practical project  
- **PostgreSQL** — SQL engine used for query execution  

---

## Key Takeaways
Completing the Associate Data Analyst Certification demonstrates the ability to:

- Clean, manipulate, and validate structured data  
- Conduct exploratory analysis to uncover insights  
- Apply statistical concepts to support business experimentation  
- Communicate findings effectively to stakeholders  

This certification provides a solid foundation for a career in data analytics, business intelligence, and data-driven problem solving.
